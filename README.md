## 🚀 Software Engineer | Full-stack Developer | Cloud & AI Enthusiast

I’m Hector Triviño Gonzalez, a software engineer passionate about building scalable applications and solving complex problems. My work spans cloud infrastructure (AWS, Terraform, Serverless, GCP), front-end architecture (Next.js, React, Tailwind, design systems), and backend services (Python, FastAPI, Node.js, MySQL, DynamoDB, Firestore).

I’ve worked on projects in healthtech and fintech, where I designed systems for real-time data aggregation, onboarding flows, and FHIR-based integrations. I also experiment with AI/ML (transformers, time-series, NLP, HuggingFace) and automation workflows for document processing and data pipelines.

💡 Always exploring ways to optimize developer experience, system performance, and user experience.
